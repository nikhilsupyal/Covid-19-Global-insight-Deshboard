# Covid-19-Global-insight-Deshboard
Just completed a COVID-19 Analytics Dashboard in Power BI!
It highlights key metrics like total cases, recoveries, deaths, active cases, and testing trends, along with continent-wise and country-level comparisons.
This project helped me practice data cleaning, visualization, and deriving business insights from real-world data.
